# EN Version:

A website created using Springboot as backend API, and Angular as frontend.

Angular sends search bar results to springboot, with the option to download if missing. Here download basically means scrapping the novel and its chapters from a real novel website, which in this case www.boxnovel.com.

Other than that, it saves your progress by login and offers a way to bookmark your favourite quotes with a side note.

I had real fun creating this project and actually, as a vivid novel reader, I was actively for some months continuously and still am using it. This is because I don't always have access to Internet but my PC is almost always in my bag. This was basically my favourite project to date.
